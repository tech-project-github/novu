# Push Notifications

Novu can be used to deliver push notifications to your customers devices using a unified delivery API. Both Mobile and Web push notifications are supported.

You can save a user's notification/device identifiers using [Subscriber Credentials](/platform/subscribers#updating-subscriber-credentials).

You can easily integrate your favorite delivery provider using the built-in [integration store](https://web.novu.co/integrations).

To read a provider specific documentation:
